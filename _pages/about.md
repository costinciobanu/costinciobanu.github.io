Welcome to my personal-professional website. I am a PhD Candidate at McGill University. I study political behaviour and particularly participation and motivation of online political activists. I study these phenomena in Canada and other mature democracies. Methodologically, I work with survey, census, and social media data with an additional interest in data science, machine learning, natural language processing and computational social science more generally. 

I am currently a research fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship which is a multi-university research center that seeks to better understand the relationship between citizens and political processes. I also work with the Canadian Digital Democracy Project as Senior Political Analyst. I am also affiliated with the Max Bell School for Public Policy and the Network Dynamics Lab.

My research is funded by the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council, from whom I hold a Joseph-Armand Bombardier Scholarship. I am thankful for SSRHC, the CSDC, the DDP, and McGill -- I am fortunate to have such an amazing job.

I grew up on the prairies in Winnipeg, Manitoba and miss the urban forest and magical prairie sky. In my spare time you can find me cycling, enjoying a game of spikeball in one of Montreal's many beautiful parks, or fighting the lords of the underworld as Tarkin the Paladin.
