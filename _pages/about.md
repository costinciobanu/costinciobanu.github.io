Welcome to my professional website! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at McGill University. I study voting behavior, with a particular interest on campaign effects and on how different types of economic shocks impact electoral outcomes. My main regional focus is on Central and Eastern Europe, but my work looks at these phenomena in Western European and North American contexts as well. Methodologically, I work with survey and administrative data, with an additional interest in causal inference. My work is forthcoming at <em> The Journal of Politics</em>.

I am currently a research fellow at the [Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://www.mcgill.ca/csdc-cecd/) which is a multi-university research center that seeks to better understand the relationship between citizens and political processes.

My research is funded by the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council, from whom I hold a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship. I am thankful for SSRHC, the CSDC, and McGill.
