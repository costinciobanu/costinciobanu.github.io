Welcome to my academic website! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Aarhus University](https://ps.au.dk/en), working on a project that seeks to understand what politicians believe about voter behavior. Before joining Aarhus University, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Royal Holloway](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/politics-and-international-relations/) (University of London), within the ERC-funded ["New parties in the news"](https://www.newnewsproject.com/) project. In 2022, I obtained a Ph.D. in Political Science from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/), with a thesis on the political and electoral consequences of economic shocks. During my Ph.D. studies, I was a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC)](https://csdc-cecd.ca/).

My work lies at the intersection of political and voting behavior, political communication, and international political economy. Using observational and experimental methodologies, I explore the electoral consequences of economic and political events; I mainly focus on electoral campaigns and the role of information and media in shaping votersâ€™ attitudes and behavior. My main regional focus is on Central and Eastern Europe, but my work looks at these phenomena in Western European and North American contexts as well. My passion for politics pre-dates my academic career, as I have been a political communications consultant and analyst in Central and Eastern Europe for more than 10 years.

My work was published in [<em> The Journal of Politics</em> ](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/711177) and [<em> European Journal of Political Research</em>](https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12604).
